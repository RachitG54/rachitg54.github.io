I am a 5th Year Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student at the [Computer Science and Engineering department](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. My research interests are in cryptography (applied and thoeretical), theoretical computer science. I am currently pursuing my M.Tech thesis in post-quantum cryptography under the guidance of professor [Shweta Agrawal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~shwetaag) at IIT Madras. 

I spent a wonderful summer in 2016 at Purdue University, USA under the guidance of professor Aniket Kate and Srivatsan Ravi. I am grateful to them for introducing me to the beautiful field of cryptography. Since then I have been actively researching in cryptography to solve interesting problems that are a consequence of our digital age. In 2017, I interned at IBM Research in the area of permissioned blockchain networks. I worked on introducing priority for faster transaction rate of certain immediate transactions (such as healthcare transactions).
During the summer of 2017, I worked with professors [Shweta](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~shwetaag) and [Manoj Prabhakaran](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mp) at IIT Bombay for introducing a working prototype that allows multiple data owners to outsource their data to a cloud so that multiple clients can now securely search and compute on it. The work is currently under review.
Today, my research focuses mainly on post-quantum cryptography, notably, cryptography based on the hardness of lattice problems. Please feel free to contact me and know further about my research!
